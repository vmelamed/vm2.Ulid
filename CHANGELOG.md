## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-23

### Added

- IClock interface and SystemClock implementation to get the current time used by UlidFactory (testsbility!).
- JSON serializers for both `System.Text.Json` and `Newtonsoft.Json`
- Method `public readonly bool TryWriteUtf8(in Span<byte> destination)` (see also [Changed](#changed) below)
- Implicit conversion to/from `string` and `Guid`
- Unit tests for the new features above and the fixed bug below.
- A lot of CI/CD workflow improvements and scripts to automate the release process (see also [Internal](#internal) below).

### Changed

Small API changes that clarify the semantic of some input parameters:

- Change the constructor `public Ulid(in ReadOnlySpan<byte> bytes)` to `public Ulid(in ReadOnlySpan<byte> bytes, bool isUtf8)`.
  The constructor used to guess whether the input is raw bytes or UTF-8 sequence of characters by the length of the parameter
  `bytes`. Now, let the caller state their intention explicitly.
- Similar change for `public readonly bool TryWrite(Span<byte> destination, bool asUtf8)` - added the explicit parameter
  `asUtf8`.
- Keeping the semantics of the `Parse` and `TryParse` methods: always parsing either UTF-16 characters (`ReadOnlySpan<char>`) or
  UTF-8 characters (`ReadOnlySpan<byte>`).
- Minor stylistic code changes.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where the UlidFactory could produce non-monotonic ULIDs when called within the same millisecond and the last byte of
  the previous ULID was `0xFF`.

### Performance

- Small optimization of `UlidToString()`: Using the new `string.Create` (thank you Stephen Toub!).

### Internal

- build pipeline changes

## Usage Notes

1. For every change, prefer small bullet points written in the imperative mood (e.g. "Add …", "Fix …").
2. Group changes under the appropriate heading above; add new headings only when needed.
3. Before creating a stable tag:
   - Move items from `Unreleased` into a new `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section.
   - Update the comparison links at the bottom if a major/minor line starts a new baseline.
4. Do not rewrite history of published versions—append corrections in a new entry if needed.

## Categorization Guidance

| Category     | Use for                                                            |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Added        | New public APIs, features, options                                 |
| Changed      | Backward-impacting behavior changes (document clearly)             |
| Fixed        | Bug fixes                                                          |
| Performance  | Measurable speed / memory improvements                             |
| Removed      | Deprecated APIs removed; breaking removals                         |
| Security     | Vulnerability fixes, hardening, dependency CVE responses           |
| Internal     | Build, CI, tooling, refactors without API / behavior change        |

## After Tagging

When you create a stable tag (e.g. `v1.2.0`):

1. Add the dated section.
2. Adjust `[Unreleased]` link to compare new tag to `HEAD`.
3. Add a new link definition for the released version.

(Adjust initial tag if your first stable differs.)
