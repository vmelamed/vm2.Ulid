Usage:

    ${script_name} [--<long option> <value>|-<short option> <value> |
                    --<long switch>|-<short switch> ]*

    This script tries to find and download the latest artifact created by
    previous runs of the specified workflow.
    All parameters are optional if the corresponding environment variables are
    set. If both are specified, the command line arguments take precedence.

Switches:$common_switches

Options:
    --artifact | -a
        Specifies the name of the artifact to download. Optional.
        Initial value from \$ARTIFACT_NAME.

    --directory | -d
        The path to the artifact directory where to download the artifacts.
        Optional. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.
        If it exists and it is not empty, its contents will be clobbered without
        warning.
        Initial value from \$ARTIFACT_DIR or './BmArtifacts/baseline'

    --repository | -r
        Specifies the GitHub repository in the form 'owner/repo' where to find
        the workflow. Optional.
        Initial value from \$REPOSITORY.

    --wf-name | -n
        Specifies the name of the workflow as shown in the GitHub Actions UI.
        Optional.
        Initial value from \$WORKFLOW_NAME.

    --wf-path | -p
        Specifies the path of the workflow file in the repository, e.g.
        '.github/workflows/run-benchmarks.yml'. Optional.
        Initial value from \$WORKFLOW_PATH or ''.

    --wf-id | -i
        Specifies the ID of the workflow. Optional.
        Initial value from \$WORKFLOW_ID or ''.

    Note:
        1) If none of the --wf-* options are specified, the script will try to find
        the workflow by the first non-empty environment variable WORKFLOW_NAME,
        WORKFLOW_PATH, and WORKFLOW_ID in that order.
        2) If more than one --wf-* options are specified, only the last one is
        considered.
        3) If one of the --wf-* options is specified, the environment variables
        will be ignored.
